Quick 'n' Dirty Ecartis and Exim 4 Setup
========================================

If, like me, you hated the idea of having 6 aliases for every mailing list on
your system, you'll probably want something similar to this.

It's quite simple, and could be fragile if you're not careful.  Pay attention.
This document assumes some understanding of how to configure Exim 4.


Exim Setup
----------

Exim needs two more routers setting up, plus one transport and a domain list:

At the top of the config file, you want:

	domainlist ml_domains = dsearch;/usr/local/ecartis/domains/

Replace the path with where you want to keep your vhosts.  There will be one
directory per host, with the exact name of each domain.

You will probably need to add this to your acl, like so:

	  accept  domains       = +local_domains : +ml_domains

You should also alter your main routers; wherever you see:

	domains = !+local_domains

Change it to:

	domains = !+local_domains : !+ml_domains


Now comes the fun bit.  We want ecartis@$domain to work, so add another
router:

	ecartis:
	  driver = accept
	  domains = +ml_domains
	  local_parts = ecartis
	  transport = ecartis_pipe

And we also want list and list-($command)@$domain to work, so:

	mailing_list:
	  driver = accept
	  local_part_suffix = -requests : -repost : -admins : -moderators : -bounce
	  local_part_suffix_optional
	  require_files = /usr/local/ecartis/domains/$domain/$local_part
	  domains = +ml_domains
	  transport = ecartis_pipe

This is the bulk of the work; we should now be accepting mail for our list
domains, and they should be pointing to our ecartis transport provided the
mailing list exists.

The transport is simply:

	ecartis_pipe:
	  driver = pipe
	  return_output
	  command = /usr/local/ecartis/run_ecartis.sh

Now you're done setting up exim.  Don't forget to -HUP it when you're ready to
test it.


Ecartis Setup
-------------

First, we need to make our wrapper.  My run_ecartis.sh looks like this:

	#!/bin/sh

	COMMAND="/usr/local/ecartis/ecartis"
	HOST_TEMPLATE="domains"

	case $LOCAL_PART_SUFFIX in
	        -bounce)        opt="-bounce" ;;
	        -moderators)    opt="-moderators" ;;
	        -admins)        opt="-admins" ;;
	        -repost)        opt="-a" ;;
	        -request)      opt="-r" ;;
	        *)
	                if [ $LOCAL_PART = "ecartis" ]; then
	                        opt=""
	                        LOCAL_PART=""
	                else
	                        opt="-s"
	                fi ;;
	esac

	exec ${COMMAND} -c ${HOST_TEMPLATE}/${DOMAIN}/vhost.cfg ${opt} ${LOCAL_PART}

Now you need to mkdir /usr/local/ecartis/domains/, and for each domain you want
to have mailing lists on, mkdir /usr/local/ecartis/domains/foo.example.com,
making sure they're owned by the ecartis user.  Do NOT use a domain that
you currently handle, this MUST be a dedicated domain or subdomain.

Write vhost.cfg for each domain which overrides the relevent variables, ala:

	hostname = lists.aagh.net
	lists-root = domains/lists.aagh.net

Tune the global ecartis.cfg to taste, and then run:

	ecartis -c domains/lists.example.com/vhost.cfg -newlist listname

To create a mailing list as normal.

You're now pretty much done.  Write some scripts to manage domains and list
creation, make sure list errors point to somewhere that doesn't go straight
back to ecartis (since it'll cause a nice mail loop), and play until it works
how you like.

Don't forget you can do things like:

	mbox-archive-path = domains/<$hostname>/<$list>/archives/

In the global config; this will result in list archives in the obvious place.
One thing you must have in the global config is:

	listserver-address = ecartis@<$hostname>

Which is what our first transport in exim was for; this is for confirmation
messages and so on.

A simple add-domain.sh:

	#!/bin/sh

	HOST_TEMPLATE="/usr/local/ecartis/domains"

	host=${1:?Please specify a host}
	base="${HOST_TEMPLATE}/${host}"

	if [ -e $base ]
	        then
	        echo "Looks like domain ${host} is already set up."
	        exit
	fi

	mkdir -m og-w $base
	mkdir -m og-w ${base}/SITEDATA
	touch ${BASE}/SITEDATA/cookies

	chown -Rv ecartis $base
	chgrp -Rv ecartis $base

	echo "Creating base config..."
	cat >"${base}/vhost.cfg" <<EOF
	hostname = $host
	lists-root = domains/$host
	logfile = domains/$host/ecartis.log
	EOF

	echo "All done!"

And add-list.sh:

	#!/bin/sh

	ECARTIS="/usr/local/ecartis/ecartis"
	HOST_TEMPLATE="/usr/local/ecartis/domains"

	host=${1:?Please specify a host}
	list=${2:?Please specify a list}
	base="${HOST_TEMPLATE}/${host}"

	if [ ! -e $base ]
	        then
	        echo "Please run add-host.sh ${host}"
	        exit
	fi

	echo "Executing: ${ECARTIS} -c domains/${host}/vhost.cfg -newlist $list"
	${ECARTIS} -c domains/${host}/vhost.cfg -newlist $list
